# Coding4Fun
These samples are designed for exploring the lighter side of development. Our goal is pretty simple; create fun and entertaining code samples that feature the more interesting APIs available on Windows 10. You can expect a variety of projects that include complete, well-commented source code, provided under the MIT open-source license, and documentation on how to build the sample. 
Each sample will list what is required, but the requirements for most are simple:

- Ensure you are using the most up-to-date version of [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade) 
- [Visual Studio 2015 and Windows developer tooling](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads)

If Windows 10 Mobile is required, the emulator or device can be used.

## Using the Samples
To download the entire Coding4Fun example tree, [download via the master.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/Coding4Fun/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository.

## Deeper Dive
The [Building Apps for Windows blog](http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/) is a great spot for deep dives into Window API features along with up-to-date news and announcements. For information about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these examples, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows 10 documentation available in the [Windows Developer Center.](https://dev.windows.com/) These samples are provided "as-is" in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows.

Another great spot for samples is the [Universal Windows app samples on Github.](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples)
